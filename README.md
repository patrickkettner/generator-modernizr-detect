# generator-modernizr-detect


## Getting Started

This is a [yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator to create new modernizr detects. While you are more than welcome to use it, unless you are creating them on a regular basis you almost certainly don't actually need it.

If you _do_ want to, make sure you install it globally so yeoman can find it

```bash
npm install -g generator-modernizr-detect
```


## Using The Thing

This generator requires an existing modernizr repo. If you haven't done so already, clone the [modernizr repo](https://github.com/modernizr/modernizr/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modernizr/modernizr.git
```

and then run this generator from within that repo

```bash
yo modernizr-detect
```
